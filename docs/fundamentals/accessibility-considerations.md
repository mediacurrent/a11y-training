# Accessibility Considerations & Inclusive Design

What should you consider when thinking about accessibility?

Accessibility is related to permanent disabilities such as blindness and deafness, but it also touches on things like color blindness, cognitive issues such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder, and dexterity issues. It also includes temporary disabilities such as limited dexterity as a result of an injury or the effects of eye surgery.
Inclusivity is an important ideal and is at the center of what accessibility is trying to accomplish. Committing to an accessible website is to make it inclusive to everybody who comes to the site. By doing this, we make digesting content on the site easier for everyone, not only those with specific needs.

Consider curb cuts, the swatches cut out of sidewalks that create a ramp from the curb to the street. These were initially added to help people who use wheelchairs. After they were installed, it was discovered they also benefited people pushing baby strollers, those riding bicycles, skateboarders, people with pushcarts, and others.
The idea is the same for the web. If we increase the color contrast of a site, we may be doing it to assist those with low vision or color blindness, but it also helps mobile users who are using your site while outdoors in bright light.
Inclusive design is not one-size-fits-all; to be inclusive you must consider the different experiences of many different users as they move through your site.

What does this mean? The most prominent example comes from the use of images and alternative text. Alternative text, often abbreviated as alt-text, is a word or phrase that can be inserted as an attribute in an HTML document to tell users the nature or contents of an image. By adding alt-text to all images on your site, people using screen readers can access the same information as those who are able to see the images on each page. This caters to the needs of the visually impaired and helps craft a positive experience for them, but it also makes the information on the page readable for site crawlers, possibly improving your Search Engine Optimization performance.
