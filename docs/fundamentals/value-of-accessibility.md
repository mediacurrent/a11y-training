# The Value of A11y
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was passed in 1990 to protect individuals with disabilities. One of the key measures of this law was ensuring “access barriers”. At the time this meant physical barriers, like wheelchair access ramps. However, the interpretation of access barriers has since been expanded to include the web. Ensuring your website meets accessibility standards should not be an afterthought, but rather an ongoing effort to ensure compliance.
Legality aside, there are also other benefits from having an accessible website:

* Increased user engagement by improving the user experience for as many users as possible
* Take problem solving for the human perspective to a new level by increasing the desirability factor for a wider audience.
* Improved public relations by letting your visitors know you are committed  to making your site accessible.
* SEO can greatly benefit from accessibility standards. By employing some accessibility best practices like semantic markup, alt tags and metadata you’re not only making your site easier to use for people with disabilities, but also easier to interpret for search engines.
* Another advantage of accessibility is expanding your market and user audience. If your site is inaccessible to people with disabilities, you’re losing users. According to the [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/27/7-facts-about-americans-with-disabilities/), 12.6% of the United States population has some form of disability.
* Risk mitigation by complying with today’s laws and regulations.

From a public relations perspective it is essential for all people to know that you are trying to make your site accessible to each and every person that may want to visit it. Your brand will better resonate with users and potential users if they know you are working toward as much inclusiveness as possible.
